Ever since [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) was released in 2013, I always wanted to self-host and try it. It wasn't blogger or wordpress. It looked cleaner. It was more lightweight. But I never had my own server or the time (honestly) to host my own "ghost" blog.

When I moved from Azure to GCP earlier this year, I decided to do it. I finally had it up and running! It was perfect..... it was .. kind of ... way too perfect.
