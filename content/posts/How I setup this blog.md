Ever since [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) was released in 2013, I always wanted to self-host and try it. It wasn't blogger or wordpress. It looked cleaner. It was more lightweight. But I never had my own server or the time (honestly) to host my own "ghost" blog.

When I moved from Azure to GCP earlier this year, I decided to do it. I finally had it up and running! It was perfect..... it was .. kind of ... way too perfect. It was an overkill for what I wanted to do. I just wanted a plain blog with text. As minimal as I can possibly let myself be.

...

I created a version with "Courier Prime" which looked .. pretty neat!

But, then I realised that the posts were not readable, I didn't want to sacrifice looks for functionality at least once in my god damn life!
