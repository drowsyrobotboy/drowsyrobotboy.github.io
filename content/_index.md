I am a Security Architect from Hyderabad, India. I work at a Cyber Security Firm called [SecurDI](https://securdi.com)

For the last 11 years, I have been helping clients with Identity Security and DevOps. I am also an experienced Technical Manager invested in building and enabling teams to deliver their best on critical projects.

When I am not designing solutions for clients as an architect, I spend my free time designing websites. I have been doing this for almost 20 years now. I am also a sucker for linux & self-hosting. You might notice that a lot of my [posts](/posts) are usually about this.

I am also an ardent music lover and an "initially-trained-later-self-taught" musician. I make some [tunes](https://www.youtube.com/@drowsyrobotboy) every now and then!
