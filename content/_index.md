I am a Security Architect from the beautiful city of Hyderabad, India. I work at a Cyber Security Firm called [SecurDI](https://securdi.com) 

I have more than a decade of experience in helping clients with Identity Security and DevOps. I am also an experienced Technical Manager invested in building and enabling teams to deliver their best on critical projects.

I’ve led identity and security transformation initiatives across sectors—retail, energy, insurance, and finance—solving problems like:
- Automating user lifecycle management (JML)
- Designing CIAM and workforce IAM architectures
- Migrating legacy access systems to cloud-native SSO
- Scaling access policies with automation and infrastructure-as-code

Whether it’s a zero-trust rollout using AM Products such as Okta / PingFederate, or containerizing them on cloud k8s clusters, I care about building systems that are reliable, secure, and elegant.
